		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		My name is Yvonne Hume and I am a senior at CSU-Pueblo.
		I love to paint and draw.
		My favorite mediums to work with are oil and acrylic paint.
		I have experience with ceramics, photography, 3D art, adobe
		photoshop/illustrator and working with a variety of other mediums.
		I am married with no children. I have been living in Pueblo for
		four years. I moved to Pueblo from Denver in 2014 because my
		husband purchased his first home here in our beautiful city of
		Pueblo. I love children, animals and I care about environmental
		issues such as global warming and pollution. My goal is to become
		an art teacher in the state of Colorado.

		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>
		I was born in Monterey, California and raised in a rural town of
		Georgia, but after living  here for 21 years, I call Colorado my home.
		I come from a single parent household. My mother is from South Korea
		and English is not her first language. She had a difficult time
		raising me and my two siblings, but she did the best she could and
		instilled within us, strong ethical values that include hard work,
		honesty, and respect for others.
		</p>
		<p>
		Although I grew up in a very small town in the south, I am very
		grateful of my childhood. I played every day outside with my siblings.
		We climbed trees, went on hikes at rock eagle and bike rides. We
		caught fireflies during summer nights and put roly poly bugs on fire
		with magnifying glass during the day.
		</p>
		<p>
		My great grand parents had a strong influence on my childhood as well.
		They lived in a beautiful Neoclassical architecture home built in the 19th century. 
		I think growing up in their house is what influenced me to love art from a young age. 
		It had large doric columns with a beautiful carved out victorian-era ceiling
		in the living room. Their house over looked a garden with a fountain in the back
		yard and we lived in the cottage behind the home. The cottage was originally intended
		for slaves during the 1800’s. I loved catching my great-grand mother’s wild white cats
		that lived in her rose bushes and climbing their humungous pecan tree in their backyard.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have loved art since I was a young child. I started to become serious about drawing
		in junior high. It was the words of my middle school art teacher, “draw what you see,
		not what you think you see,”  that had pivotal impact on my art work that improved it
		drastically. I knew then that I wanted a career in art. I actually stopped drawing and
		creating art during my twenties due to being young, wild, and crazy, but returned to
		my beloved passion in my thirties. In 2016, I decided that I needed to pursue my
		dreams of becoming an art educator and enroll into college to reach that goal.
