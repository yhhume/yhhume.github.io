		<p>
		My name is Yvonne Hume and I am a senior at CSU-Pueblo.
		I love to paint and draw.
		My favorite mediums to work with are oil and acrylic paint.
		I have experience with ceramics, photography, 3D art, adobe
		photoshop/illustrator and working with a variety of other mediums.
		I am married with no children. I have been living in Pueblo for
		four years. I moved to Pueblo from Denver in 2014 because my
		husband purchased his first home here in our beautiful city of
		Pueblo. I love children, animals and I care about environmental
		issues such as global warming and pollution. My goal is to become
		an art teacher in the state of Colorado.
